Please download the dataset from http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/  
Or simply run ```bash ./download.sh``` we provide.  


Somehow the training and testing dataset zip files are with the same name, from the celltrackingchallenge Nature method paper link above . Thus on windows we first replace (1) by -test as shown in rename.sh and then unzip all the files for further processing. On Linux we replace ".1" accordingly. Please check and uncomment corresponding commands according to your system.
